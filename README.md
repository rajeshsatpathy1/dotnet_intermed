# dotnet_intermed
A repo to explore the dotnet intermediate exercises ( https://www.udemy.com/course/csharp-intermediate-classes-interfaces-and-oop/ ) by using a gpt LLM as the prompting solver.

## Structure and Aim
The results of each exercise are posted at their respective .md files in the prompt_explore folder. As the whole of the exercise is solved using a gpt llm's response, the explanations will include the hurdles it faced and how prompting was used to improve the results. The initial prompts are the questions provided in the exercise, and are not discussed on further.

The exercise pdf files are available with the course and are not shared publicly for obvious reasons.
