# Q: Design a Stack

The initial prompt was followed by prompt to add test cases and asking for a better implementation. The response suggested a LinkedList to improve but made a mistake by skipping some important points. In this case it failed to mention the need to have an access to pointer of the element to be deleted when trying to explain its time complexity. This made its response wrongly interpreted and presented. This was clarified across several follow up prompts which touched arraylists and linkedlists. The test cases initially provided had expectations of read to confirm. This was later prompt converted to include automation by replacing them with if-else blocks. What I found amazing was it's understanding of the prompt `Can you add an if else instead of comments for a better automated testing` and provide an expected answer.
