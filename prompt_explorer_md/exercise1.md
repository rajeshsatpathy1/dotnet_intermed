# Q1: Design a Stopwatch

The initial solution provided made the use of encapsulation and exception handling as queried by the question.
It was further prompted to give test cases that covered the Stopwatch class. In the 4th test case, it 
made an error to not include a stop, affecting the results of the 5th test case. It was further prompted
to go through it's own code to find the error. It successfully found the error and provided a solution
that included the exception by making use of the 'finally' block.

# Q2: Design a StackOverflow Post

The solution provided made the use of encapsulation and private variables as queried by the question.
It was further prompted to give test cases, addition of an id for each post and access method for it.
It gave a solution which used the dictionary collection and updated the relevant test cases. It accessed
public and private members as required.
