# Q1: Design a Stopwatch

The solution provided made the use of encapsulation and exception handling as queried by the question.
It was further prompted to give test cases that covered the Stopwatch class. In the 4th test case, it 
made an error to not include a stop, affecting the results of the 5th test case. It was further prompted
to go through it's own code to find the error. It successfully found the error and provided a solution
that included the exception by making use of the 'finally' block.
